# ZJJ Rust Toolchain Configuration
#
# ZJJ REQUIRES Rust nightly due to:
# - Dynamic log levels in tracing macros (telemetry.rs)
# - Advanced type system features for error handling
#
# See docs/16_RUST_NIGHTLY.md for complete rationale and migration considerations.
#
# This file ensures consistent nightly usage across all environments.
# When you run cargo/rustc in this directory, rustup automatically activates nightly.

[toolchain]
channel = "nightly-2025-12-15"
# Pinned to a known-working nightly version (2025-12-15)
# Latest nightly (2026-01-08+) broke dynamic log levels in tracing macros

# Components
components = ["rustfmt", "clippy", "rust-analyzer"]

# Target support - add platforms as needed
targets = ["x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"]
