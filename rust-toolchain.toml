# Using stable Rust - the codebase has no nightly dependencies.
# Previously documented telemetry system using dynamic log levels does not exist.
#
# This file ensures consistent toolchain usage across all environments.
# When you run cargo/rustc in this directory, rustup automatically activates stable.
