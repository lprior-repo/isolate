One by one work through all open or in progress beads tasks please until the list is empty and make sure it fits within codebase consistency and use rust functional skill please as well here. So every loop start with tdd15 and rust functional skill keep going and use as many sub agents as possible on each loop to maximuze speed of completion well maintaining increidbly high elvels of engineering rigor
