# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack in rsa crate
#
# Status: Accepted Risk
# Reason: This vulnerability affects RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption timing side-channels.
#         - We only use SQLite (not MySQL) in zjj
#         - The rsa crate is a transitive dependency via sqlx-mysql -> sqlx-macros-core
#         - sqlx-macros unnecessarily pulls in MySQL dependencies even when unused
#         - We perform no RSA operations in our codebase
#         - No fixed version available as of 2026-01-16
#
# Mitigation: Monitor for updates to sqlx that remove this dependency from macros
# Review Date: 2026-01-16
# Next Review: When sqlx 0.9 is released
