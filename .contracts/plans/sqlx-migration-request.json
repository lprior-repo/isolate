    "codebase": "Rust project zjj-core with existing beads.rs module (read-only query interface for .beads/beads.db SQLite database). Current implementation uses rusqlite (synchronous blocking). Already has db.rs using sqlx async for session management. Strict functional Rust enforced: zero unwraps, zero panics, forbid(unwrap_used, expect_used, panic). Moon build system required.",

      "Must maintain exact same API surface for pure functions (filter_issues, sort_issues, etc)",
      "Cannot break existing call sites in watcher.rs, dashboard.rs, commands",

      "Must pass moon run :test (all tests)",
