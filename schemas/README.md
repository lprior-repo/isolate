# ZJJ Schema Files

CUE schemas for project planning, validation, and code generation.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `architecture.cue` | System architecture definitions |
| `commands.cue` | CLI command specifications |
| `config.cue` | Configuration schema |
| `layouts.cue` | Zellij layout templates |
| `requirements.cue` | Project requirements |
| `research.cue` | Research and planning schemas |
| `cicd.cue` | CI/CD pipeline definitions |

## Usage

These schemas were used during initial project planning and design. They are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Future validation
- Code generation if needed

**Note**: The source of truth is the Rust code in `crates/`. These schemas are supplementary.
